# Etch-a-Sketch Project

I developed this project to practice front end skills and to deepen my knowledge of CSS and Javascript, as a part of [The Odin Project](www.theodinproject.com)'s Foundations Course. ü§ì

Try it out here üëâüèæ [Etch-a-Sketch](https://igormsoares.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) !

## Overview

A web version of the awesome classical retro drawing toy (or tool? ü§î)

### Color Modes

You can choose between **13 different solid colors** and also experiment with **three color modes**

![Color Modes Demo gif](https://igormsoares.github.io/public/gifs/etch-a-sketch/color-modes.gif)

The **amount of squares** in the canvas can be customized, being limited to a maximum of **100 squares per row** (on large screens) or to the maximum possible number to fit your _screen width_ so the squares don't get too small nor the canvas overflows the screen.

### Grid lines

Want the squares in the canvas to be all together without any borders around? No problem! Just use the **Hide Grid** option

### Share your artwork!

And if you want to keep your drawing or share it with the world, just press the **download button** and your artwork will be saved as a _.jpeg_ image üòâ

### Responsive Layout

You can use it on your personal computer or laptop but it will work equally nice on **mobile devices** as the layout and the canvas will adapt to all screens wider than _300 pixels_

## Shoutout

The icons used on this project (the brush, eraser, instructions arrows and download icon) I got from the awesome site [icons8](https://icons8.com.br/).

The gifs used in this README were created using [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) a super great open source tool made by [Nicke Manarin](https://github.com/NickeManarin).
